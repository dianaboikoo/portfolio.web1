      Worked on the development of a digital car-matching platform that helps users find the best car offers for leasing or buying based on their personal preferences. My work included frontend and backend development using JavaScript and Python, Firebase integration, data handling from APIs, and building a dynamic user form with real-time car matching. Focused on creating a user-friendly, transparent, and personalized car search experience.

MealPlan is a React single-page app, where meals, recipes, and shopping lists are the main building blocks. The interface is built from small, reusable components and uses React Router to move between screens. We keep app data in React hooks with simple derived helpers. CRUD flows use the Fetch API to persist changes to Firebase Realtime Database. Accessibility was built in from the start with labeled forms, clear error states, high contrast, alt text, and an intuitive onboarding flow. The result reduces food waste and planning time while encouraging a healthier, low-pressure relationship with food.

        Book Space is a React web app that keeps both casual and enthusiastic readers engaged through personalized recommendations, goal & streak tracking, a distraction-free reading mode, community groups & discussions, reviews, and notes/quotes management. My team and I implemented a modular component architecture with React + JavaScript and responsive layouts, focusing on fast client-side interactions and simple, maintainable code.

PIER is a responsive web app that unifies VIP/table reservations for Italian nightclubs. The platform sits on WordPress with custom HTML/CSS and JavaScript for dynamic pricing, dropdown flows, and add/remove-to-order logic. WooCommerce powers products and checkout, while Tockify handles events and B Carousel/Max Mega Menu cover media and navigation. My team and I optimized structure and components from a Figma system and verified performance with Lighthouse; the result is a clear booking experience ready to scale.

A lightweight web app that helps students quickly find laptop-friendly cafés in Copenhagen. The solution was shaped by desk research, on-site observations, and interviews, then mapped with affinity diagrams, personas, VPC, and OOUX to define clear selection criteria (Wi-Fi reliability, outlets, noise level, seating, time limits). The UI presents a clean, responsive list + map embed with filtering and simple detail views so users can choose a spot fast. Accessibility and performance were checked throughout, and the design iterated from lo-fi to hi-fi prototypes.

    <p>
Quick Info is a React web app created to help Coop reduce supermarket food waste by making essential product details instantly accessible and actionable. The interface gives fast lookups for key information (ingredients/allergens, nutrition, origin, price/availability) and supports store workflows aimed at lowering waste (e.g., highlighting near-expiry items and guiding next steps). The solution was informed by Double Diamond research (desk + field), mapped via personas, VPC, and OOUX, and validated through lo-fi/hi-fi prototypes and testing. The result is a clean, responsive UI that enables staff and customers to make better, faster decisions with less friction.
